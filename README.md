- Hi, I’m Willie Loftie-Eaton
- I’m interested in Mathematics, Computer Science, guitar, and philosophy.
- I’m currently studying BSc Computer Science at the University of Stellenbosch (2nd year). I'm learning Java, C, and Python.

I created a document (learning_log.txt) to show my learning relating to software development.
